            Fetal health prediction involves sophisticated analysis of cardiotocography (CTG) data and other vital measurements. Our model processes these parameters through carefully trained neural networks to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate potential health concerns, enabling early intervention when necessary.
Pregnancy is a beautiful journey, and weâ€™re here to help you navigate it safely. By looking at simple things like age, blood sugar, and blood pressure, we can help spot any potential risks and give you the guidance you need for a healthy and happy pregnancy.
