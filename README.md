## Backend
Framework:

Flask: Python web framework for creating RESTful APIs
Flask-CORS: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) between frontend and backend
Machine Learning & Data Science:

Scikit-learn: ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), data preprocessing, and evaluation
NumPy: Numerical computations and random seeding
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (DataFrames, Series)
Data Visualization:

Matplotlib: Core plotting library for visualizations
Seaborn: Advanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots, etc.)
API Communication:

JSON: Data format for frontend-backend communication via REST APIs
## Frontend
Framework & Libraries:

React (JavaScript & TypeScript): UI library for building interactive interfaces
Vite.js (Implied): Modern build tool (inferred from CORS port 5173)
Framer Motion: React animation library for smooth UI transitions
Lucide-react: Icon library for scalable and customizable SVG icons
AI Integration:

@google/generative-ai: Library for integrating Googleâ€™s Generative AI (e.g., text or image generation)
HTTP Requests:

Axios: Handles API calls between React frontend and Flask backend
State & DOM Management:

useState, useRef: React hooks for managing component state and references
StrictMode & createRoot: React 18+ features for better rendering and strict checks
Styling:

CSS (index.css): Global styling and layouts
## Data Communication
REST API (JSON):
Flask serves as the API layer, communicating with the React frontend using JSON-formatted data.
Axios handles API calls on the frontend side.
